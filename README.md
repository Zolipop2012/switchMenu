# switchMenu

My best attempt at recreating the Nintendo Switch menu UI using HTML/CSS/JS. Check the latest build at [https://superswitchmenu.netlify.app/](https://superswitchmenu.netlify.app/)

This will probably look silly on anything other than a Chrome browser on desktop, though Firefox might render it alright. Safari has some trouble...
